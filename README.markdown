# Cross-Platform Data Visualization with React & React Native

Check out the slides online [here](https://react-conf-data-viz.surge.sh/#/)! This presentation was built with [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) and [Victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory).

## Slides
This repo contains all of the slides & chart components featured in my ⚡️ talk for React Conf 2017. All Victory cross-platform charts are in `charts/` and all UI components are in `presentation/`.

## Questions
If you have any questions about the charts I built or any of my Spectacle code, please feel free to open an issue or start a conversation on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/peggyrayzis).

## Build Locally

If you want to run the project locally, please fork & clone the repo. Install all dependencies with `npm i` (please don't run `yarn`, it doesn't install my forked copy of `spectacle-code-slide` properly) and run `npm run start` to start the webpack server.
